description: "Thank you to all of the kind folks who, in walking or driving past the Baha'i Center in Concord, have stopped to ask about or admire the landscaping.  Feel free to drop a note with any contact information you wish to share if you would like cuttings.  The volunteer landscaper will be happy to let you know when pruning or separating is in order."
